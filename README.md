<h1>Faction-Council-Representatives</h1> 

<p>Faction Council Representatives are leaders who help govern the game, grow the game and most of all love playing the game. Every <a href="https://github.com/369gtech/Factions">Faction</a> will have a leader who is voted into their position by the players in that Faction which will be held yearly. Faction Leaders then can choose 3 helpers who will help them run their Faction. The positions on the Higher Council will be based on player stat's, so the player with the best battle stat's in the highest league will be Chief of War and that player will have 3 positions that player can choose to help to communicate and coordination with the Factions battles, teach players how to battle (strategy) and be able to give rewards to players for their involvement. So each Higher Council Member will be able to choose 3 helpers to help them in their team and all Higher Council Members will be rewarded. Remember those Higher Council Members are permanent for one year and then the game will look review those stat's to see if changes need to be take place. So lets look at the structure of the Faction.

Every member of the Faction starts of with being a beginner. You are then required to do some easy welcoming quest to become a Council Member and become a Citizen of monoGames. Then it is up to every player who wants to be a Higher Council Member to achieve the stat's to be in those position to reward players for their hard work in the game. The Faction leader is voted in to that position by the Faction every year. More detail will come when the game is about to start.
