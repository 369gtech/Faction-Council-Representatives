<h1>Faction-Council-Representatives</h1> 

<p>Faction Council Representatives are leaders who help govern the game, grow the game and most of all love playing the game. Every faction will have a leader who is voted into their position by the players in that faction which will be held yearly. Faction leaders then can choose 3 helpers who will help them run their faction on the higher council. The other positions on the higher council will be based on player stat's. So the player with the best battle stat's in the highest league will be Chief of War and he will have 3 positions that he can choose to help him to communicate coordination with the factions battles, teach players how to battle (strategy) and be able to give rewards to players for their involvement. So each higher council member will be able to choose 3 helpers to help them in their team. Remember those higher council members are permanent for one year, so lets look at the structure of the Faction.

Every member of the faction starts of with being a beginner. You are then required to do some easy quest to become a Council member. Then it is up to every player who wants to be a Higher Council Member to achieve the stat's to be in those position to reward players for their hard work in the game. The Faction leader is voted in to that position by faction as a whole. Every position will be available once a year to compete for. More detail will come when the game is about to start.
